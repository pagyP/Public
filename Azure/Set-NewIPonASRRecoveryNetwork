# This script is useful to take Protected Items in a recovery vault, go through all the items and set a recovery IP based on the Source IP. 
# In this case, the regex will replace the third octet of a /24 IP only, so it retains the first, second and fourth octet. This makes for a 
# cleaner transition when the VMs are replicated to a DR network where the only difference is the third octet.
# ie 192.168.0.4 --> 192.168.1.4 
# Assumes there is only one NIC on the VM 

# Connect to your Azure subscription then run the following 

Set-AzRecoveryServicesAsrVaultContext -Vault (Get-AzRecoveryServicesVault) # This is your vault, should be in your DR region. 
$fabrics = Get-AzRecoveryServicesAsrFabric
$Container = Get-AzRecoveryServicesAsrProtectionContainer -fabric $fabrics[1] # check this is the protected fabric, source region of protected items
$ProtItems = Get-AzRecoveryServicesAsrReplicationProtectedItem -ProtectionContainer $container # check this is your protected container, source region of protected items  

Foreach ($prot in $protitems)

	$props = @{
		InputObject 			= $Prot
		RecoveryNicStaticIPAddress 	= $Prot.NicDetailsList[0].PrimaryNicStaticIPAddress -replace "\d{1,3}(?=\.\d{1,3}$)","1"
		PrimaryNic 			= $Prot.NicDetailsList[0].NicID
		RecoveryNetworkId 		= $Prot.NicDetailsList[0].RecoveryVMNetworkId

# Sometimes if the IP is taken this process may fail. In that case, have a think about making sure the IPs in the target site are available.
